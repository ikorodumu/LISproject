            <h2 class="top">What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p> Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, and preferences that influence our judgments and behaviors toward others, often without our awareness. These biases are shaped by societal norms, cultural contexts, and personal experiences, and they can affect decisions in areas like hiring, education, healthcare, and social interactions. While not inherently malicious, implicit bias can perpetuate inequality and discrimination, as it leads to automatic, often unfair assumptions about people based on characteristics like race, gender, age, or appearance. Recognizing and addressing these biases is crucial for fostering fairness and inclusivity in everyday life. </p>

            <h2>Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
            <p> The implicit bias test (IBT) reveals how we subconsciously associate positive or negative words with different images, uncovering biases shaped by societal influences like media, cultural norms, and upbringing. These biases, often unnoticed, can intersect with aspects of identity such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status, impacting experiences of discrimination. For example, someone raised in a rural area might lack exposure to discussions on racism, leading to unintentional biases rooted in limited education rather than malice. While challenging and educating others is important, addressing implicit bias ultimately depends on individual willingness to recognize and unlearn these cognitive shortcuts, which are natural but require conscious effort to overcome. </p>
