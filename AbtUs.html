                <p>Hi my name is Noa Levine and I am originally from New Jersey. I am a junior at UW- Madison studying Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies as well as Information Science. I am currently studying abroad in Madrid for the semester which speaks to my love for exploring new things. From trying new foods and activities to thrift shopping to spending time with friends, I love to fill my times with things that bring me joy. I love going to the beach and hanging out with any dog, specifically my dog chester. I’m the founder of Set Me Up, a college concierge and organizing service. I help students navigate their transition to college life, making things like organization and settling in a lot easier. I’m always on the lookout for exciting activities and new experiences.</p>
