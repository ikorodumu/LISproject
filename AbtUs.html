                <p>Hi my name is Noa Levine and I am originally from New Jersey. I am a junior at UW- Madison studying Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies as well as Information Science. I am currently studying abroad in Madrid for the semester which speaks to my love for exploring new things. From trying new foods and activities to thrift shopping to spending time with friends, I love to fill my times with things that bring me joy. I love going to the beach and hanging out with any dog, specifically my dog chester. I’m the founder of Set Me Up, a college concierge and organizing service. I help students navigate their transition to college life, making things like organization and settling in a lot easier. I’m always on the lookout for exciting activities and new experiences.</p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Hari Kang. I am currently a senior majoring in Data Science. Ever since I started exploring the field, I have been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be transformed into meaningful insights. I love my major because it allows me to work with various datasets, visualize complex information in an intuitive way, and make predictions based on real-world trends.

                    One of the aspects I find most exciting about Data Science is the ability to tell a story through data visualization. Numbers and raw data can often feel overwhelming, but when presented through clear and engaging visualizations, they become easier to interpret and can lead to more informed decision-making. Additionally, working with machine learning models to make data-driven predictions is something I am eager to explore further.
                    
                    As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I hope to combine my passion for Data Science with my personal interests. My goal is to use data-driven insights to improve people's lives, whether through technology, health analytics, or even applications in food and sustainability.
                    
                    I am always eager to learn new things, take on challenges, and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving. If you’d like to connect, feel free to explore the rest of our website!</p>
